Description: A toolkit for Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). Provides
    bindings to C++ libraries implementing the algorithm SARSOP (Successive Approximations
    of the Reachable Space under Optimal Policies and described in Kurniawati (2008),
    <doi:10.15607/RSS.2008.IV.009>.  This package also provides a high-level interface
    for generating, solving and simulating POMDP problems and their solutions.
